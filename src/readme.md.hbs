**Dynamic multiple inheritance for JavaScript and TypeScript. Without mixins.**

**Polytype** is a library that adds support for dynamic
[multiple inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance) to JavaScript and
TypeScript with a simple syntax.
“Dynamic” means that changes to base classes at runtime are reflected immediately in all derived
classes just like programmers would expect when working with single prototype inheritance.

Polytype uses
[proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
along with other relatively new language features to provide multiple inheritance.
Some of these features are not yet well supported in all browsers.
As of today, Polytype runs in **current versions of Chrome, Firefox,
Safari<sup>[[*notes*](#compatibility "Safari is only partially supported. See the Compatibility
section for details.")]</sup>, Opera and in Node.js**.
As JavaScript support in other browsers improves, Polytype will start to run in those browsers, too.

## Setup Instructions

Polytytpe is available in two flavors: a module version with exported definitions and a script
version where all definitions are accessible through global objects.
Apart from this, both versions provide the same features and are available in the standard package.

You are free to choose whichever version of Polytype best fits your requirements, but make sure to
remain consistent throughout your application: mixing the module and the script versions together is
not recommended and may produce unexpected results.

### In Node.js

If you are using Node.js, you can install Polytype with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org).

```console
npm install polytype
```

Then you can import it in your code like any module.

```js
const { classes } = require("polytype"); // CommonJS syntax
```
or
```js
import { classes } from "polytype"; // ECMAScript module syntax
```

In TypeScript you can also import certain types where necessary.

```ts
import { SuperConstructorInvokeInfo } from "polytype";
```

Alternatively, you can import the script version at the start of your application and access
Polytype definitions through global objects.

```js
require("polytype/global"); // CommonJS syntax
```
or
```js
import "polytype/global"; // ECMAScript module syntax
```

### In the browser

In an HTML-based application, the script version of Polytype can be simply embedded.
Just download [polytype.min.js][polytype.min.js] from GitHub and include it in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="polytype.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can hotlink the current stable version using a CDN of your choice.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/fasttime/Polytype/{{version}}/lib/polytype.min.js"></script>
```

If your browser application already uses ECMAScript modules, you can also import the module version
(“.mjs”) in contexts where Polytype-specific definitions like `classes` are required.
This has the advantage to avoid possible naming conflicts on global objects.

```js
import { classes } from "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/fasttime/Polytype/{{version}}/lib/polytype.min.mjs";
```

## Usage

### Inheriting from multiple base classes

For example, declare a derived class `ColoredCircle` that inherits from both base classes `Circle`
and `ColoredObject`.

```js
class Circle
{
    constructor(centerX, centerY, radius)
    {
        this.moveTo(centerX, centerY);
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    get diameter() { return this.radius * 2; }
    set diameter(diameter) { this.radius = diameter / 2; }
    moveTo(centerX, centerY)
    {
        this.centerX = centerX;
        this.centerY = centerY;
    }
    toString()
    {
        return `circle with center (${this.centerX}, ${this.centerY}) and radius ${this.radius}`;
    }
}

class ColoredObject
{
    constructor(color) { this.color = color; }
    static areSameColor(obj1, obj2) { return obj1.color === obj2.color; }
    paint() { console.log(`painting in ${this.color}`); }
    toString() { return `${this.color} object`; }
}

class ColoredCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject) // Base classes as comma-separated params
{
    // Add methods here.
}
```

### Using methods and properties from multiple base classes

```js
const c = new ColoredCircle();

c.moveTo(42, 31);
c.radius = 1;
c.color = "red";
console.log(c.centerX, c.centerY);  // 42, 31
console.log(c.diameter);            // 2
c.paint();                          // "painting in red"
```

As usual, the keyword `super` invokes a base class method or property accessor when used inside a
derived class.

```js
class ColoredCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject)
{
    paint()
    {
        super.paint(); // Using method paint from some base class
    }
}
```

If different base classes include a member with the same name, the syntax
```js
super.class(DirectBaseClass).member
```
can be used to make the member access unambiguous.

```js
class ColoredCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject)
{
    toString()
    {
        // Using method toString from base class Circle
        const circleString = super.class(Circle).toString();
        return `${circleString} in ${this.color}`;
    }
}
```

**Note:** In TypeScript, the syntax `super.class(DirectBaseClass).member` cannot be used to access
protected instance members, so it is currently not possible to disambiguate between protected
instance members having the same name in different base classes.

### Static methods and properties

Static methods and property accessors are inherited, too.

```js
ColoredCircle.areSameColor(c1, c2)
```
same as
```js
ColoredObject.areSameColor(c1, c2)
```

### Invoking multiple base constructors

Use arrays to group together parameters for each base constructor in the derived class constructor.

```js
class ColoredCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject)
{
    constructor(centerX, centerY, radius, color)
    {
        super
        (
            [centerX, centerY, radius], // Circle constructor params
            [color]                     // ColoredObject constructor params
        );
    }
}
```

If you prefer to keep parameter lists associated to their base classes explicitly without relying on
order, there is an alternative syntax.

```js
class GreenCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject)
{
    constructor(centerX, centerY, radius)
    {
        super
        (
            { super: ColoredObject, arguments: ["green"] },
            { super: Circle, arguments: [centerX, centerY, radius] }
        );
    }
}
```

There is no need to specify an array of parameters for each base constructor.
If the parameter arrays are omitted, the base constructors will still be invoked without parameters.

```js
class WhiteUnitCircle
extends classes(Circle, ColoredObject)
{
    constructor()
    {
        super(); // Base constructors invoked without parameters
        this.centerX    = 0;
        this.centerY    = 0;
        this.radius     = 1;
        this.color      = "white";
    }
}
```

### `instanceof`

The `instanceof` operator works just like it should.

```js
const c = new ColoredCircle();

console.log(c instanceof Circle);           // true
console.log(c instanceof ColoredObject);    // true
console.log(c instanceof ColoredCircle);    // true
console.log(c instanceof Object);           // true
console.log(c instanceof Array);            // false
```

In pure JavaScript, the expression
```js
B.prototype instanceof A
```
determines if `A` is a base class of class `B`.

Polytype takes care that this test still works well with multiple inheritance.

```js
console.log(ColoredCircle.prototype instanceof Circle);         // true
console.log(ColoredCircle.prototype instanceof ColoredObject);  // true
console.log(ColoredCircle.prototype instanceof ColoredCircle);  // false
console.log(ColoredCircle.prototype instanceof Object);         // true
console.log(Circle.prototype instanceof ColoredObject);         // false
```

### `in`

The `in` operator determines whether a property is in an object or in its prototype chain.
In the case of multiple inheritance, the prototype “chain” looks more like a directed graph, yet the
function of the `in` operator is the same.

```js
const c = new ColoredCircle();

console.log("moveTo" in c); // true
console.log("paint" in c);  // true
```

```js
console.log("areSameColor" in ColoredCircle);   // true
console.log("areSameColor" in Circle);          // false
console.log("areSameColor" in ColoredObject);   // true
```

### `isPrototypeOf`

`isPrototypeOf` works fine, too.

```js
const c = new ColoredCircle();

console.log(Circle.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c));         // true
console.log(ColoredObject.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c));  // true
console.log(ColoredCircle.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c));  // true
console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c));         // true
console.log(Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c));          // false
```

```js
console.log(Circle.isPrototypeOf(ColoredCircle));               // true
console.log(ColoredObject.isPrototypeOf(ColoredCircle));        // true
console.log(ColoredCircle.isPrototypeOf(ColoredCircle));        // false
console.log(Object.isPrototypeOf(ColoredCircle));               // false
console.log(Function.prototype.isPrototypeOf(ColoredCircle));   // true
```

### Dynamic base class changes

If a property in a base class is added, removed or modified at runtime, the changes are immediately
reflected in all derived classes.
This is the magic of proxies.

```js
const c = new ColoredCircle();

Circle.prototype.sayHello = () => console.log("Hello!");
c.sayHello(); // "Hello!"
```

## TypeScript support

Polytype has built-in TypeScript support: you can take advantage of type checking while working with
multiple inheritance without installing any additional packages.
If you are using an IDE that supports TypeScript code completion like Visual Studio Code, you will
get multiple inheritance sensitive suggestions as you type.
A TypeScript version of the `ColoredCircle` sample code above can be found in
[ColoredCircle.ts](example/ColoredCircle.ts) in the example folder.

## Compatibility

Polytype was successfully tested in the following browsers / JavaScript engines.

* Chrome 58+
* Firefox 52+
* Safari 11 *(Partial support. See notes below.)*
* Opera 45+
* Node.js 8+

The minimum supported TypeScript version is 3.5.

Because of poor ECMAScript compliance, Safari accepts non-constructor functions (such as arrow
functions, generators, etc.) as arguments to
`classes`,<sup>[[*issue*](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193057)]</sup> although it does
not allow instantiating classes derived from such functions.
Also, Safari does not throw a `TypeError` when attempting to assign to a read-only property of a
Polytype class or object in strict
mode.<sup>[[*issue*](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177398)]</sup>

In the current version of Edge, the JavaScript engine Chakra has
[a serious bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/issues/5883) that can produce incorrect
results when the `instanceof` operator is used with bound functions after Polytype has been loaded.
For this reason it is recommended not to use Polytype in Edge as long as this issue persists.
